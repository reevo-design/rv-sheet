### RECORD UX-2189

_During the first Reevo Earth-Mars expedition, a modular ship component called RvSheet was developed. This component became essential for ensuring intergalactic mobility and adaptability of the ship’s internal modules. During its design phase, engineers faced the challenge of creating something that could instantly isolate data or tasks from the general information space while remaining fully integrated with the ship’s core systems._

_RvSheet creates isolated work zones shielded from overloads and ambient noise. Whether it’s a strategic captain’s session or an engineering trajectory adjustment, RvSheet ensured that every task found its protected space._
